# Google-Playstore-Data-Analysis
A data analysis project related to the Google Play Store which  involves analyzing and extracting insights from the data available on the Google Play Store.
The Google Play Store is a platform where Android users can browse and download various applications, games, and other digital content for their devices.

I have two different Datasets for this project.
 1.Google Playstore Data.csv(contains records with fields like App,Category,Rating,Reviews,Memory Size,Installs,Type,Price,Content,Rating,Genres etc.,)
 2.Google Playstore User Reviews.csv(Application name,Translated_Review,Sentiment,Sentiment_Polarity,Sentiment_Subjectivity)
 
After Data Cleaning(removing Null values and duplicates) and exported these files to Tableau Dashboard for Data Visualization which includes graphs for:

1.Top 5 reviews of Application between 2010 and 2017.

2.Percentage of Free and Paid Apps in Playstore till 2017.

3.Actual and estimated number of App updates in Playstore till 2015.
